## Relevant Experience

### PM, PO, Fullstack Developer, DB Architect<time>Feb 2017 – Present</time>

<location> **Company: Ludens Productions** | Remote | Hermosillo, SON</location>
- I’m currently managing governmental projects for mexican customs; I lead 65 employees from different departments, while also taking care of the client and stakeholders. I‘m also part of the requirements’ gathering team and hence constantly create company strategies that'll allow the team to deliver the software in time and with high-quality standards.
- Researched how to implement a monitoring service `(Grafana + Loki + Promtail)` to alert developers and SysAdmins on `Discord` about new errors & exceptions triggered on the production environment. This allowed the team to detect more than **12,000 errors upon launch** and thus resolve them ASAP.
- Mentored new team members, providing support and feedback on the technologies used on the enterprise including `Python`, `Docker`, `Git`, `Kanban`, `Communication`, `JS`, `Bootstrap` & `QA/testing`.
- Satisfying the whole country’s customs’ needs has been my toughest challenge up until now since I’ve had to fill out 58 positions across 38 software projects in the last year. All of this while being understaffed and pressured with short very short delivery timelines across the 38 software projects that we delivered in a year.
- For the duration of these contracts, I've had to act as a backend dev in 8 projects, as frontend dev in 12 projects, as a Manual QA in 4 projects, as a Product Owner in 4 projects, as Project Manager in 12 projects, and as the Supervisor in 20 projects.
- We started hiring devs during 2020, so I undertook more of a management role after that year. I started supporting the development as a DB architect, PM, PO, and occasionally, as a frontend developer. Nowadays I'll usually be the developers' mentor, as well as their lead in priority management and the organization of the team's workflow.
- During my startup’s first 2 years we had no personnel (other than my 2 associates), so I acquired experience in the following areas of web development: I negotiated with the clients and acted as a Product Owner, I planned sprints/tasks as a Project Manager, I would design the DB architecture, and I would usually implement the frontend and backend in Laravel as needed.

### PM, Fullstack Dev, QA and DB Architect<time>Jan 2021 – Mar 2023</time>
<location> **Company: Electrical Grid Intelligence** | Remote | Ciudad Obregón, SON</location>

- A team of 5 programmers was led to build the MVP of EGI Systems in one month. The system maps electrical structures and detects any repairs that are needed. This software created a profitable business for Media Aérea which still offers this service to electrical companies nowadays, so the project’s maintenance & upgrades lasted for 2 more years after that. My main responsibilities were designing the DB’s Entity Relationship diagram in a week, developing the frontend in the same week, as well as managing, mentoring, and leading the backend developers during the rest of the month.
- Acted as a manual tester for a couple of months since there was no time (or personnel) at the beginning of the project to train other employees. I taught the employees how to assure the quality of the software and eventually only made QA of certain system modules. 
- As of March 2023, it has **received 200,000+** image uploads from private customers and **annotated 17,000+ anomalies**.

<!-- ### PM for "VEHICLE REGULARIZATION" <time>Mar 2022 – Mar 2022</time>
<location> **Ludens Productions** | Remote | Obregón, SON</location>
- "VEHICLE REGULARIZATION" is a service where customers can do the process of bringing unregistered or irregularly registered vehicles to comply with legal requirements
- Created a module which helps to consume a private government API to retreive vehicle information and parse it to continue the process on the project `Django` platform
- Created a multi-threaded script with `Python` to populate the production database which consumed from a private government API to retrieve  **500,000+** acknowledgment of appointments numbers
- Optimized the already uploaded PDFs size and the new PDFs using a Python library `pdfnetpython` keeping them each one lower than 5MB in size without "losing too much quality"
- Thanks to this project, we helped processing and regulating **more than 1,000,000+** irregular cars
- "CUSTOMS CROSSING NOTICES" is a system where exporters give notice to customs that they will cross with merchandise to be able to present themselves to said customs 
- Created a module using `FastAPI` which accepts both `JSON` or `XML` information that decides automatically which vehicle would be selected for internal workflows, which is used on the own `Django` project and third-party module consumption ensuring compliance with the government's strict regulations and requirements
- Implemented the module inside the `Django` project to consume my module that I mentioned above so the workers could use the module more easily
- This project is still not being used nationally for production, but the goal was to optimize the module that it doesn't exceed more than ~15ms request time, and it is currently under ~4ms

### Fullstack Developer <time>Jan 2020 – Sept 2020</time>
<location> **Company: Pixelbot** | Remote | Toronto, Canada</location>
- Developed a *Shopify* store with *Liquid* and optimized a bridge developed with PHP. This allowed the client, PackageEverything, to synchronize its products’ inventory from their inner legacy system with their new Shopify store. This reduced their operative workload and at the same time expanded their market reach into the web, which represented 25% of their sales. The bridge’s execution time was optimized 83% since it was reduced from 5 minutes to 50 seconds.

<br>

### Intern Frontend Developer <time>Nov 2018 – Oct 2019</time>

<location> **Company: Novutek** | Remote | Ciudad Obregón, SON</location>

- The company’s induction process was automated as a website. This reduced 40% of HR department’s tasks during the new employees' training process.
